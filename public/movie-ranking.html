        <h1>Top Movies of All Time According to Me</h1>
        <h2>What I think are the best 3 movies</h2>
        
        <hr/>

        <h3>Lady and the Tramp</h3>
        <p>Being a hopeless romantic, I've always loved a good love story. There's just been something about it that's always stuck with me.</p>

        <h3>Lion King 2: Simba's Pride</h3>
        <p>Similar to the last entry, I love a good love story. Plus the soundtrack is 10/10, it's very underrated compared to the success of the first film. That and I think I watched it every day one summer in middle school.</p>

        <h3>Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio</h3>
        <p>Now this is a new one for me. For the longest time I would've filled this slot with Thor: The Dark World or maybe with Black Panther. Those movies are pretty renowned already, though, so I figured I'd highlight something that didn't get much hooplah. I've never been big on the Pinocchio story but this particular telling really rips your heart out and makes you think.</p>
